Out of nowhere this lady with BOB sticker on her trunk swerves all the way over right in front of me with no blinker. So I honked and pulled up next to her to see what the deal is.

"I was expecting him to spill water all over her.  But the precision in that pour was impressive. This happened with my lower lip in elementary school. A teacher actually told me to stop playing and eat my popsicle. I wound up ripping a bunch of skin off of the inside of my lip. Once as a kid I was with my family at Dairy Queen. I went outside to grab something from the car and (for some reason) I touched a metal pole (one of those that are sometimes between parking spots and walkways). My hand froze to it.

Luckily I can see my family through the window and I wave at them frantically to come out. They just wave back. Luckily my sister's friend was with us and actually was nice enough to come out and see why I was waving like that.

They brought out a cup of warm water and I got my hand off, and my skin was white (I'm a white person, but my skin wasn't normal Caucasian white, it was like snow or paper or the walls of a mental hospital).Watch ""Tongue Stuck to Popsicle"" on YouTube
https://youtu.be/7LnwLZ7y-M0

With sound Oof, this gives me some flashbacks. 

One time we got free popsicles at school (elementary school, I think I was in 3rd grade). The teacher who brought them in had them on dry ice... Dozens of kids got their lips and/or tongues stuck to the popsicles. The bathrooms were littered with bloody paper towel at lunch. 

Not fun. Cute girl, funny, slightly sexual. This is goin to the top folks. I‚Äôve done this...not pleasant when it happens...trying to get saliva onto your tongue to melt the popsicle...I'm impressed by her lack of a gag reflex. Is it really a tongue stuck to a popsicle? Or a popsicle stuck on a tongue?Once my mom got this extremely high quality fridge and I learned that it could freeze a handle of Captain Morgan if I put it on the lowest setting. This was in high school, so I was having a party and put the handle in the freezer, lowered the setting and waited overnight for it to freeze. The next day, in the afternoon before people were going to come over, I grabbed a popsicle from the freezer, opened it up and put it straight in my mouth. My tongue instantly froze to it, which stung so i yanked the popsicle out of my mouth. I looked at it and could actually see bits of my tongue frozen to the popsicle. Little taste buds or whatever they are. Then I tasted blood.

I was actually bleeding way more than you would think. The worst part of it was I couldn't even eat the popsicle because it stung so bad on my wounded tongue.

It's also obvious, based on spray pattern on her clothes, that it was sprayed on her while she was lying on her right side on the ground. Maybe a park.

"Or was it the bird that was speeding ?Nice timing with the bird, but I'm curious, what would the ticket be for? Looks like a car sitting on the side of the road to me. 

Is there some law in England or wherever this image was taken that the car is violating?Is that like a 1980ish Mitsubishi Sigma? My first ever car was a beige station wagon one of those. I can't see from the photo if it's the older round headlights or the later square headlights.Not all hero's wear capes Isn't England by the looks of it but would get a ticket if parking for longer that the legal limit. Some areas you only get to park up for an hour with a disc display (you display the time you parked up and they determine if you've over stayed from this - without the display you get a ticket.)They have cameras to monitor that?
In America we only have cameras at *some* intersections, to catch red light runners.Ehh, just me guessing at the location based on the left side traffic and it looks like a pound symbol on the first line of red numbers to me:)

So if I am understanding correctly, the driver places a placard on their dash (or somewhere) that indicates the time they parked their car there and that is used to determine if they have stayed too long? Seems like a neat system until that day you realize that you forgot your display back at home:P Is it just an honor system for the driver to put down the correct time, or do they have to get it from a kiosk on the side the street or something like that?

Where I live at the only places where you will get a ticket for parking too long are at parking meters:P On a residential street like this as long as you move the car every 3 days you are fine:)Parking Attendants use cameras as proof. Pretty much that (first question). Some shops nearby offer them for free but depends where in the country that is but yeah if you forget it you're risking getting a ticket if you park. Most people just keep them in their cars. 

It's an honour system I suppose cause you can try and cheat the system by putting a later time on but you risk the parking attendant seeing the display at a time ahead of the current time or the opposite, see you parked at a certain time and later coming back to see the same car but with the time extended as if it just parked up recently. This can get you a ticket too - usually most parking spots are up to 1 hour no return for 2 hours. Meaning once you park there, you can't just move the car down a bit and expect not to get a ticket. 

All in all it depends where in England it is. Each council has different rules. Where I live it's impossible to park for free as most spaces are reserved for disabled. End up parking in supermarkets who offer free Parking for 2 hours which is more than enough. ",t3_8o7mpo,9,Someone was saved from a ticket by a bird.,161

"""Who you calling a Dickhead, you fucking spastic!""  
  
Classic.Bravo mate, now there's bloody fuckin price on ya head mate. Back in the 90‚Äôs you could get 3-way calling as a feature for your phone (landline). Me and a friend both had that feature, so we‚Äôd get on the phone with each other, click over to our other line and each call a different pizza place at the same time and then click over to bring us all together. We‚Äôd stay quiet as each pizza place would argue over who called the other on.

This feature: while on the phone with someone, you could click over to a ringtone, dial someone else and then click back over to bring all three people together. If the person you‚Äôre talking to has it, you could bring in a forth person. I guess you could keep bringing in people as long as the people you bring in have the feature. Never got past four people personally.Now I finally know why that girl that called me told me that I called her.Makes me proud to be Australian This is the logic built into the new Google assistant when she gets the wrong number.Did these guys meet at a Parkinson's support group?Could they not move their hands so much!I could spend all day listening to Australian pranks calls. Irish and Scottish as well.
I‚Äôd love to see more of these two way prank calls. I tried googling and got nothing. SOS ",t3_8o4mh1,39,No u called me mate !!,1041

I said, ""It's for a duck!"" ""Oh, then it's free."" I did not know that. Ducks eat for free at Subway! Had I known that, I would have ordered a much larger sandwich.

https://abcnews.go.com/US/fbi-agent-accidentally-shoots-bar-patron-gun-falls/story?id=55614488The hands thrown up at the end as if saying ""it wasn't me ""It went off ? Fuck man. Archer? Is that you???Negligent discharge. What a joke.. this moron should not have been dancing with a handgun in his waistband in the first place. I do not believe there was a holster used here which may have kept his striker fired Glock in his pants. Notice how the firearm did not discharge itself when it hit the ground. Keep your finger off the trigger until you've acquired your target and are aware of what's behind it. Also what could soon be in front of said target in a moments time. This idiot should know that. Stay safe. Clearly the FBI is spending more time on dance instruction than gun safety these days Alcohol and guns don't mix.Wut?Old mate in the shorts and cap shit himself and legged itDid it fire?

She wasn‚Äôt sure if she was excited or embarrassed. She‚Äôs never done anything like that before.

She thought I knew that it was an Amtrak and convinced me to get her a mani/pedi as retribution.

I hope she learns to be a skilled and talented violinist!I didn't start by playing violin, but I've been playing piano since ~4 years old. In the beginning, you're basically starting from complete scratch with knowledge and motor skills so they're trying to build up musicality and not just skill with the instrument.
For her, this is a pretty effective way of getting young kids to listen to the music, and know where their note/queue falls in a piece. And it's a fun way too!
Lol I remember my first concert, my parents recorded it. Basically my teacher played a beautiful melody in her right hand sitting beside me on the piano bench, and I was just banging away with a solid chord in my left hand! It was to teach me to keep a steady rhythm lmaoIt is only about self esteem these days and not the instrument and skills.  


Thats why we give trophies to losing teams in elementary school sports.  
Its not about achieving.  
Wait, you are a dumb\-ass, right ? Ok, now it makes sense.That totally makes sense.She isn't even doing anything here.  


And no, that's not the way you learn an instrument. What you describe is just messing around, and not learning motor skills. You can teach keeping a steady rhythm in different ways, and if its just using the same 2 or 3 notes over and over. The later giving you also some motor skills.  


With an instrument like the violin its playing an open string, over and over, until you learned how to get a few consecutive nice sounding notes.

*shrug* All I know is with all the junk the big companies are pulling these days I am very tempted to make my next PC a Linux system:PYour current PC could be a Linux system. Just download Ubuntu/Mint/Fedora or whatever and install. You can try them out without installing by booting from the USB or using a VM like virtual box. Oh I know. I have a few virtual machines running Ubuntu, Mint, Android, even a RetroPie:P that I mess around with a little. Has a lot of stuff that I like, but learning a new OS from scratch is a bit of a task.

Main issue is I've been playing PC games for nearly 30 years now. I've got quite a library of windows games that don't play too well on Linux. I'm not frustrated enough with windows yet to bother trying to make them run on wine or something. At least on the bright side, the emulator I use to run windows 98 on has a Linux port so making the old games work shouldn't be too hard:P",t3_8o7mwz,4,Mac or PC?,7

"Is this post from 1990? Must not be in the USA.It blows my mind that so many parents think it's cool to basically give their kids candy for breakfast just because it's cereal Sugar cereals have been but usually they were a little more subtle about it weren't they?Couple bowls of allergy inducing dyes and chemicals loaded with sugar and B vitamins in the morning and no one can figure out why lil Timmy can't concentrate and is being diagnosed with ADHD and hyperactivity in school...................The original Cookie Crips are from 1977 :)Sounds like a post from someone who knows nothing about food science and formulation and is just trying to be edgy. All of these breakfast cereals, especially ones marketed towards kids ( if they have an equity character on the box), have to adhere to federal nutrition guidelines. For example, this picture was taken in Canada because it is bilingual (French & English) which is required by Canada. Canada has even stricter nutrition guidelines than the US, and we often have to make separate formulation for CDA and US versions of the same product. Or maybe you think we just mix a bunch of sugar and oats together to make cereals without any rules to follow...... Everything in a commercially sold food must be approved by the FDA.

Here is a fun one, on a lot of cereals we worked hard to remove artificial dyes and flavors (you'll notice its says right on the box of Cookie Crisp as an example), and then people complained because they didn't like how their food looked and stopped buying certain cereals. We had to go back to the original formulation to maintain sales. 

Just because sugary foods are bad as a diet staple, does not mean they shouldn't exist for people to enjoy once in a while. Or should we be banning cake, cookies, donuts, ice cream, candy bars, etc?? The majority of parents dont feed cereals like this to their kids daily, it is seen as a treat, and maybe eaten on the weekends. I know, as part of my job is consumer research on eating trends. But I only do this for a living and this is reddit so I'm sure everyone knows more than me.No no, must be the vaccinationsCouldn't possibly be diet!

Meanwhile, I have other scout parents call home and Mom answers. Knowing my dad had already come and left, she told them he was on his way back. Friendly parents wait with me for 10 minutes for my dad who should have been there in 5. They then drive me home after it's apparent my dad isn't returning.
Back at home, dad shows up 10 minutes later, arms full of food, proudly proclaiming, ""I got Chinese food!"" To which my dearest mother replies, ""that's great, but what about your son?""

Oh.She was carrying him in her shirt but he fell out of a hole.One time my dad forgot to pick me up from basketball practice because he got drunk while watching the Packers game and forgot.  I let it slide though because he also has a phat ass and some rockin' tits.She just wanted to make sure that they shot her from the back as well as the front. I don't care for her but she has enough people that she probably asked someone and they didn't do it. You can see her realizing someone didn't and the instant (this is going to be a thing now) look.[removed]I promise that I'm the last person you'd see defending any Kardashian when they do stupid shit, HOWEVER...

It is possible she was walking out to make sure there was a car seat or perhaps she thought one of her guards had him. I don't see any audio for this and I'm too lazy to Google it, but yeah...

Parents also forget their kids all the time. It's not like she left without him. Calm down.

Edit: I wasn't saying the possibilities I listed were true or even the only possibilities. I was just saying there were a lot of assumptions going around.

And I should've clarified that I meant parents forget their kids inside when they go out to their car frequently, not parents forgetting their kids at home as they drive away (although I'm sure that also happens once in a while). Everybody makes airhead mistakes occasionally.  It must suck that every time she makes one somebody is there to record it and share it with the entire world.
